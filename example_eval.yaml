name: Eval Example  # do we need this?
description: This is an example of an eval. An eval contains a set of prompts and tests.
prompts:
  - This is a question/prompt.
  - |
    This is a followup prompt.
    The intent is to evaluate multiple responses in a conversation, rather than a single response.
# optional; default tests (e.g. % of code blocks passing) along with performance metrics (characters per second) will still be recorded
ideal_responses:
  - |
    This is the ideal response (to the first prompt).
    This field is optional.
    It is only used if a test below is of type `llm-similarity`, in which case it is used as the ideal response and the LLM is asked to evaluate the similarity of the response to the ideal answer.
    This value could also be used to fine-tune a model.
  - This is the ideal response to the second prompt.
tests:
  - type: match
    value: This is the expected response. It must match exactly.
  # This is an test that uses a python function to evaluate the response.
  # The function is defined in `example_test.py` and is called `test_function`.
  - type: python
    file: example_test.py
    function: test_function
  # This is an test that uses a python function to evaluate the response.
  # The function is defined directly in the yaml file. It can be named anything but must take a
  # single argument, the response, and return a list of TestResult objects. 
  - type: python

      def test_function(response: str) -> list[TestResult]:
        expectation_1 = TestResult(passed=..., description='This is a description of the expecation.')
        expectation_2 = TestResult(passed=..., description='This is a description of the expecation.')
        return [expectation_1, expectation_2]
  # This type of test is used to evaluate the similarity of the response to the ideal answer.
  # The ideal answer should be captured in the `ideal_response` field, above.
